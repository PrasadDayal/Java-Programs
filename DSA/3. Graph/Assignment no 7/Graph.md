## Overview

This program provides functionalities to read the edges of a graph, display the adjacency matrix, and perform BFS or DFS traversal starting from a specified vertex.

## Features

- Read edges of the graph from user input.
- Display the adjacency matrix of the graph.
- Perform Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal.
- Perform Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the Java source files using the command:

    ```bash
    javac Main.java
    ```

4. Run the program using the command:

    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose between BFS and DFS, input the number of vertices, edges, and the starting vertex.

## Sample Input

When running the program, you will be prompted to enter the number of vertices, edges, and the edges of the graph. Here's a sample input:
