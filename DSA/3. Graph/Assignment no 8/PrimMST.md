## Overview

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. The algorithm starts with an arbitrary vertex and grows the spanning tree by adding the cheapest edge that connects the tree to a vertex not yet in the tree until all vertices are included.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the Java source file using the command:

    ```bash
    javac PrimMST.java
    ```

4. Run the program using the command:

    ```bash
    java PrimMST
    ```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of edges, vertices, and the details of each edge (source, destination, and weight).

## Sample Input

When running the program, you will be prompted to input the number of edges, vertices, and the details of each edge. Here's a sample input:
