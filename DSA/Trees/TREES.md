This repository contains a Java program for a Binary Search Tree (BST) with various functionalities. The program allows users to create a tree by level, insert nodes using an array, find the number of nodes on the longest path from the root, find the minimum value, swap left and right pointers, search for a value, and perform inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals.

[`TreeNode.java`:](https://github.com/ShrihariKasar/Java-Programs/blob/main/DSA/Trees/TreeNode.java) Tree Implementation in Java
[`Node.java`:](https://github.com/ShrihariKasar/Java-Programs/blob/main/DSA/Trees/Node.java) Tree Implementation by taking its level from user in Java
[`BST.java`:](https://github.com/ShrihariKasar/Java-Programs/blob/main/DSA/Trees/Assignment-no-3%264/BST.java) Java program to demonstrate basic operations on a Binary Search Tree (BST) 

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Java program on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Git installed on your machine.

## Program Features
- Create a tree by level: Enter the level of the tree and values for each level to construct the binary search tree.
- Insert new nodes using an array: Enter the size of the array and values to insert nodes into the binary search tree.
- Find the number of nodes on the longest path from the root: Determine the maximum number of nodes on the longest path from the root.
- Find the minimum data value in the tree: Retrieve the minimum value present in the binary search tree.
- Swap left and right pointers of each node: Modify the tree by swapping the left and right pointers of each node.
- Search for a value: Check if a specific value exists in the binary search tree.
- Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversals: Display the nodes of the tree using these traversal methods.

# 2. Expression Tree

This Java program demonstrates the creation and manipulation of an expression tree.

An expression tree is a binary tree where each internal node represents an operator and each leaf node represents an operand. This program allows users to insert an expression, delete a node from the expression tree, and display the postorder traversal of the expression tree.

## Features

- Insert an expression into the expression tree.
- Delete a specified node from the expression tree.
- Display the postorder traversal of the expression tree.

# 3. Threaded Binary Tree

This Java program implements a threaded binary tree, which is a binary tree where some nodes have additional links (threads) that facilitate traversal. 

## Overview

- **Insertion**: Nodes can be inserted into the threaded binary tree using an array.
- **Deletion**: Nodes can be deleted from the threaded binary tree.
- **Traversal**: Inorder and preorder traversal of the tree can be performed.

## Features

- Insert nodes into the threaded binary tree using an array.
- Delete a specified node from the tree.
- Display the inorder and preorder traversal of the tree.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Follow the on-screen menu to perform set operations.
