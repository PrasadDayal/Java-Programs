# Binary Search Tree Java Program

This repository contains a Java program for a Binary Search Tree (BST) with various functionalities. The program allows users to create a tree by level, insert nodes using an array, find the number of nodes on the longest path from the root, find the minimum value, swap left and right pointers, search for a value, and perform inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Java program on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Git installed on your machine.

## Program Features
- Create a tree by level: Enter the level of the tree and values for each level to construct the binary search tree.
- Insert new nodes using an array: Enter the size of the array and values to insert nodes into the binary search tree.
- Find the number of nodes on the longest path from the root: Determine the maximum number of nodes on the longest path from the root.
- Find the minimum data value in the tree: Retrieve the minimum value present in the binary search tree.
- Swap left and right pointers of each node: Modify the tree by swapping the left and right pointers of each node.
- Search for a value: Check if a specific value exists in the binary search tree.
- Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversals: Display the nodes of the tree using these traversal methods.
